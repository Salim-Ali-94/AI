PYTORCH IMPLEMENTATION

The neural_network.py library contains a set of classes for creating common neural network architecures by simply specifying the required amount of nodes in each layer along with the desired system hyperparameters. Together with these general learning models there also exist functions for carrying out useful machine learning analysis and testing.

Future work (Neural network):

The optimizer often gets stuck in a local minimum, the error plateaus to a non-zero value, learning eventually begins to slow down drastically and no measures are taken to combat over-fitting. Intended improvements include adding momentum to the network and using an adaptive learning rate with the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for tackling issues with the slow and sub-optimal training process as well as implementing early stopping to prevent overfitting.
