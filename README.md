Future work (Neural network):

The optimizer often gets stuck in a local minimum, the error plateaus to a non-zero value, learning eventually begins to slow down drastically and no measures are taken to combat over-fitting. Intended improvements include adding momentum to the network and using an adaptive learning rate with the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for tackling issues with the slow and sub-optimal training process as well as implementing early stopping to prevent overfitting.
